# Room_Occupancy_Detection
A machine learning, classification project on predicting the occupancy of a room based on sensor data.

The data is collected from
Candanedo,Luis. (2016). Occupancy Detection . UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5X01N.

## Objectives
1. To develop a binary classification model to detect occupancy based on sensor data.
2. To understand how sensor data and Internet of Things can be used for energy conversation in buildings.
